As these applications get more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\\n\\nOr, set them in Python:\\nCopyimport getpass\\nimport os\\n\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\n\\n\\u200bComponents\\nWe will need to select three components from LangChain’s suite of integrations.\\nSelect a chat model:\\n OpenAI Anthropic Azure Google Gemini AWS Bedrock👉 Read the OpenAI chat model integration docsCopypip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\\ninit_chat_modelModel ClassCopyimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\\n\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4.1\")\\n\\nSelect an embeddings model:\\n OpenAI Azure Google Gemini Google Vertex AWS HuggingFace Ollama Cohere MistralAI Nomic NVIDIA Voyage AI IBM watsonx FakeCopypip install -U \"langchain-openai\"\\nCopyimport getpass\\nimport os\\n\\nif not os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):\\n    os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for OpenAI: \")\\n\\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\\n\\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-3-large\")\\n\\nSelect a vector store:\\n In-memory AstraDB Chroma FAISS Milvus MongoDB PGVector PGVectorStore Pinecone QdrantCopypip install -U \"langchain-core\"\\nCopyfrom langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore\\n\\nvector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(embeddings)\\n\\n\\u200b1. Indexing\\nThis section is an abbreviated version of the content in the semantic search tutorial.If your data is already indexed and available for search (i.e., you have a function to execute a search), or if you’re comfortable with document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores, feel free to skip to the next section on retrieval and generation.\\nIndexing commonly works as follows:\\n\\nLoad: First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.\\nSplit: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won’t fit in a model’s finite context window.\\nStore: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bLoading documents\\nWe need to first load the blog post contents. We can use DocumentLoaders for this, which are objects that load in data from a source and return a list of Document objects.\\nIn this case we’ll use the WebBaseLoader, which uses urllib to load HTML from web URLs and BeautifulSoup to parse it to text. We can customize the HTML -> text parsing by passing in parameters into the BeautifulSoup parser via bs_kwargs (see BeautifulSoup docs). In this case only HTML tags with class “post-content”, “post-title”, or “post-header” are relevant, so we’ll remove all others.\\nCopyimport bs4\\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\\n\\n# Only keep post title, headers, and content from the full HTML.\\nbs4_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=(\"post-title\", \"post-header\", \"post-content\"))\\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\\n    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),\\n    bs_kwargs={\"parse_only\": bs4_strainer},\\n)\\ndocs = loader.load()\\n\\nassert len(docs) == 1\\nprint(f\"Total characters: {len(docs[0].page_content)}\")\\n\\nCopyTotal characters: 43131\\n\\nCopyprint(docs[0].page_content[:500])\\n\\nCopy      LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\n\\nDate: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\\n\\n\\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn\\n\\nGo deeper\\nDocumentLoader: Object that loads data from a source as list of Documents.\\n\\nIntegrations: 160+ integrations to choose from.\\nBaseLoader: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bSplitting documents\\nOur loaded document is over 42k characters which is too long to fit into the context window of many models. Even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find information in very long inputs.\\nTo handle this we’ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant parts of the blog post at run time.\\nAs in the semantic search tutorial, we use a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\\nCopyfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n    chunk_size=1000,  # chunk size (characters)\\n    chunk_overlap=200,  # chunk overlap (characters)\\n    add_start_index=True,  # track index in original document\\n)\\nall_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\\n\\nprint(f\"Split blog post into {len(all_splits)} sub-documents.\")\\n\\nCopySplit blog post into 66 sub-documents.\\n\\nGo deeper\\nTextSplitter: Object that splits a list of Document objects into smaller\\nchunks for storage and retrieval.\\n\\nIntegrations\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bStoring documents\\nNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them at runtime. Following the semantic search tutorial, our approach is to embed the contents of each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector store. Given an input query, we can then use vector search to retrieve relevant documents.\\nWe can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the vector store and embeddings model selected at the start of the tutorial.\\nCopydocument_ids = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)\\n\\nprint(document_ids[:3])\\n\\nCopy[\\'07c18af6-ad58-479a-bfb1-d508033f9c64\\', \\'9000bf8e-1993-446f-8d4d-f4e507ba4b8f\\', \\'ba3b5d14-bed9-4f5f-88be-44c88aedc2e6\\']\\n\\nGo deeper\\nEmbeddings: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 30+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nVectorStore: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 40+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nThis completes the Indexing portion of the pipeline. At this point we have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question.\\n\\u200b2. Retrieval and Generation\\nRAG applications commonly work as follows:\\n\\nRetrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\\nGenerate: A model produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\\n\\n\\nNow let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and returns an answer.\\nWe will demonstrate:\\n\\nA RAG agent that executes searches with a simple tool. This is a good general-purpose implementation.\\nA two-step RAG chain that uses just a single LLM call per query. This is a fast and effective method for simple queries.\\n\\n\\u200bRAG agents\\nOne formulation of a RAG application is as a simple agent with a tool that retrieves information. We can assemble a minimal RAG agent by implementing a tool that wraps our vector store:\\nCopyfrom langchain.tools import tool\\n\\n@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str):\\n    \"\"\"Retrieve information to help answer a query.\"\"\"\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)\\n    serialized = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(\\n        (f\"Source: {doc.metadata}\\\\nContent: {doc.page_content}\")\\n        for doc in retrieved_docs\\n    )\\n    return serialized, retrieved_docs\\n\\nHere we use the tool decorator to configure the tool to attach raw documents as artifacts to each ToolMessage. This will let us access document metadata in our application, separate from the stringified representation that is sent to the model.\\nRetrieval tools are not limited to a single string query argument, as in the above example. You can\\nforce the LLM to specify additional search parameters by adding arguments— for example, a category:Copyfrom typing import Literal\\n\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str, section: Literal[\"beginning\", \"middle\", \"end\"]):\\n\\nGiven our tool, we can construct the agent:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\n\\ntools = [retrieve_context]\\n# If desired, specify custom instructions\\nprompt = (\\n    \"You have access to a tool that retrieves context from a blog post. \"\\n    \"Use the tool to help answer user queries.\"\\n)\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools, system_prompt=prompt)\\n\\nLet’s test this out. We construct a question that would typically require an iterative sequence of retrieval steps to answer:\\nCopyquery = (\\n    \"What is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n    \"Once you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\"\\n)\\n\\nfor event in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\n\\nOnce you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337)\\n Call ID: call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337\\n  Args:\\n    query: standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR)\\n Call ID: call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR\\n  Args:\\n    query: common extensions of the standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nThe standard method for Task Decomposition often used is the Chain of Thought (CoT)...\\n\\nNote that the agent:\\n\\nGenerates a query to search for a standard method for task decomposition;\\nReceiving the answer, generates a second query to search for common extensions of it;\\nHaving received all necessary context, answers the question.\\n\\nWe can see the full sequence of steps, along with latency and other metadata, in the LangSmith trace.\\nYou can add a deeper level of control and customization using the LangGraph framework directly— for example, you can add steps to grade document relevance and rewrite search queries. Check out LangGraph’s Agentic RAG tutorial for more advanced formulations.\\n\\u200bRAG chains\\nIn the above agentic RAG formulation we allow the LLM to use its discretion in generating a tool call to help answer user queries. This is a good general-purpose solution, but comes with some trade-offs:\\n✅ Benefits⚠️ DrawbacksSearch only when needed – The LLM can handle greetings, follow-ups, and simple queries without triggering unnecessary searches.Two inference calls – When a search is performed, it requires one call to generate the query and another to produce the final response.Contextual search queries – By treating search as a tool with a query input, the LLM crafts its own queries that incorporate conversational context.Reduced control – The LLM may skip searches when they are actually needed, or issue extra searches when unnecessary.Multiple searches allowed – The LLM can execute several searches in support of a single user query.\\nAnother common approach is a two-step chain, in which we always run a search (potentially using the raw user query) and incorporate the result as context for a single LLM query. This results in a single inference call per query, buying reduced latency at the expense of flexibility.\\nIn this approach we no longer call the model in a loop, but instead make a single pass.\\nWe can implement this chain by removing tools from the agent and instead incorporating the retrieval step into a custom prompt:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest\\n\\n@dynamic_prompt\\ndef prompt_with_context(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Inject context into state messages.\"\"\"\\n    last_query = request.state[\"messages\"][-1].text\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_query)\\n\\n    docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n    system_message = (\\n        \"You are a helpful assistant. Use the following context in your response:\"\\n        f\"\\\\n\\\\n{docs_content}\"\\n    )\\n\\n    return system_message\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools=[], middleware=[prompt_with_context])\\n\\nLet’s try this out:\\nCopyquery = \"What is task decomposition?\"\\nfor step in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is task decomposition?\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nTask decomposition is...\\n\\nIn the LangSmith trace we can see the retrieved context incorporated into the model prompt.\\nThis is a fast and effective method for simple queries in constrained settings, when we typically do want to run user queries through semantic search to pull additional context.\\nReturning source documentsThe above RAG chain incorporates retrieved context into a single system message for that run.As in the agentic RAG formulation, we sometimes want to include raw source documents in the application state to have access to document metadata. We can do this for the two-step chain case by:\\nAdding a key to the state to store the retrieved documents\\nAdding a new node via a pre-model hook to populate that key (as well as inject the context).\\nCopyfrom typing import Any\\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\\nfrom langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, AgentState\\n\\n\\nclass State(AgentState):\\n    context: list[Document]\\n\\n\\nclass RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware(AgentMiddleware[State]):\\n    state_schema = State\\n\\n    def before_model(self, state: AgentState) -> dict[str, Any] | None:\\n        last_message = state[\"messages\"][-1]\\n        retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_message.text)\\n\\n        docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n        augmented_message_content = (\\n            f\"{last_message.text}\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n            \"Use the following context to answer the query:\\\\n\"\\n            f\"{docs_content}\"\\n        )\\n        return {\\n            \"messages\": [last_message.model_copy(update={\"content\": augmented_message_content})],\\n            \"context\": retrieved_docs,\\n        }\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model,\\n    tools=[],\\n    middleware=[RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware()],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bNext steps\\nNow that we’ve implemented a simple RAG application via create_agent, we can easily incorporate new features and go deeper:\\n\\nStream tokens and other information for responsive user experiences\\nAdd conversational memory to support multi-turn interactions\\nAdd long-term memory to support memory across conversational threads\\nAdd structured responses\\nDeploy your application with LangSmith Deployments\\n\\n\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\nConnect these docs programmatically to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoBuild a semantic search engine with LangChainPreviousBuild a SQL agentNext⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify')],\n",

Indexing\\nThis section is an abbreviated version of the content in the semantic search tutorial.If your data is already indexed and available for search (i.e., you have a function to execute a search), or if you’re comfortable with document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores, feel free to skip to the next section on retrieval and generation.\\nIndexing commonly works as follows:\\n\\nLoad: First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.\\nSplit: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won’t fit in a model’s finite context window.\\nStore: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bLoading documents\\nWe need to first load the blog post contents. We can use DocumentLoaders for this, which are objects that load in data from a source and return a list of Document objects.\\nIn this case we’ll use the WebBaseLoader, which uses urllib to load HTML from web URLs and BeautifulSoup to parse it to text. We can customize the HTML -> text parsing by passing in parameters into the BeautifulSoup parser via bs_kwargs (see BeautifulSoup docs). In this case only HTML tags with class “post-content”, “post-title”, or “post-header” are relevant, so we’ll remove all others.\\nCopyimport bs4\\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\\n\\n# Only keep post title, headers, and content from the full HTML.\\nbs4_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=(\"post-title\", \"post-header\", \"post-content\"))\\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\\n    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),\\n    bs_kwargs={\"parse_only\": bs4_strainer},\\n)\\ndocs = loader.load()\\n\\nassert len(docs) == 1\\nprint(f\"Total characters: {len(docs[0].page_content)}\")\\n\\nCopyTotal characters: 43131\\n\\nCopyprint(docs[0].page_content[:500])\\n\\nCopy      LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\n\\nDate: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\\n\\n\\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn\\n\\nGo deeper\\nDocumentLoader: Object that loads data from a source as list of Documents.\\n\\nIntegrations: 160+ integrations to choose from.\\nBaseLoader: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bSplitting documents\\nOur loaded document is over 42k characters which is too long to fit into the context window of many models. Even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find information in very long inputs.\\nTo handle this we’ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant parts of the blog post at run time.\\nAs in the semantic search tutorial, we use a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\\nCopyfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n    chunk_size=1000,  # chunk size (characters)\\n    chunk_overlap=200,  # chunk overlap (characters)\\n    add_start_index=True,  # track index in original document\\n)\\nall_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\\n\\nprint(f\"Split blog post into {len(all_splits)} sub-documents.\")\\n\\nCopySplit blog post into 66 sub-documents.\\n\\nGo deeper\\nTextSplitter: Object that splits a list of Document objects into smaller\\nchunks for storage and retrieval.\\n\\nIntegrations\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bStoring documents\\nNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them at runtime. Following the semantic search tutorial, our approach is to embed the contents of each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector store. Given an input query, we can then use vector search to retrieve relevant documents.\\nWe can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the vector store and embeddings model selected at the start of the tutorial.\\nCopydocument_ids = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)\\n\\nprint(document_ids[:3])\\n\\nCopy[\\'07c18af6-ad58-479a-bfb1-d508033f9c64\\', \\'9000bf8e-1993-446f-8d4d-f4e507ba4b8f\\', \\'ba3b5d14-bed9-4f5f-88be-44c88aedc2e6\\']\\n\\nGo deeper\\nEmbeddings: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 30+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nVectorStore: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 40+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nThis completes the Indexing portion of the pipeline. At this point we have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question.\\n\\u200b2. Retrieval and Generation\\nRAG applications commonly work as follows:\\n\\nRetrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\\nGenerate: A model produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\\n\\n\\nNow let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and returns an answer.\\nWe will demonstrate:\\n\\nA RAG agent that executes searches with a simple tool. This is a good general-purpose implementation.\\nA two-step RAG chain that uses just a single LLM call per query. This is a fast and effective method for simple queries.\\n\\n\\u200bRAG agents\\nOne formulation of a RAG application is as a simple agent with a tool that retrieves information. We can assemble a minimal RAG agent by implementing a tool that wraps our vector store:\\nCopyfrom langchain.tools import tool\\n\\n@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str):\\n    \"\"\"Retrieve information to help answer a query.\"\"\"\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)\\n    serialized = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(\\n        (f\"Source: {doc.metadata}\\\\nContent: {doc.page_content}\")\\n        for doc in retrieved_docs\\n    )\\n    return serialized, retrieved_docs\\n\\nHere we use the tool decorator to configure the tool to attach raw documents as artifacts to each ToolMessage. This will let us access document metadata in our application, separate from the stringified representation that is sent to the model.\\nRetrieval tools are not limited to a single string query argument, as in the above example. You can\\nforce the LLM to specify additional search parameters by adding arguments— for example, a category:Copyfrom typing import Literal\\n\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str, section: Literal[\"beginning\", \"middle\", \"end\"]):\\n\\nGiven our tool, we can construct the agent:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\n\\ntools = [retrieve_context]\\n# If desired, specify custom instructions\\nprompt = (\\n    \"You have access to a tool that retrieves context from a blog post. \"\\n    \"Use the tool to help answer user queries.\"\\n)\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools, system_prompt=prompt)\\n\\nLet’s test this out. We construct a question that would typically require an iterative sequence of retrieval steps to answer:\\nCopyquery = (\\n    \"What is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n    \"Once you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\"\\n)\\n\\nfor event in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\n\\nOnce you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337)\\n Call ID: call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337\\n  Args:\\n    query: standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR)\\n Call ID: call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR\\n  Args:\\n    query: common extensions of the standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nThe standard method for Task Decomposition often used is the Chain of Thought (CoT)...\\n\\nNote that the agent:\\n\\nGenerates a query to search for a standard method for task decomposition;\\nReceiving the answer, generates a second query to search for common extensions of it;\\nHaving received all necessary context, answers the question.\\n\\nWe can see the full sequence of steps, along with latency and other metadata, in the LangSmith trace.\\nYou can add a deeper level of control and customization using the LangGraph framework directly— for example, you can add steps to grade document relevance and rewrite search queries. Check out LangGraph’s Agentic RAG tutorial for more advanced formulations.\\n\\u200bRAG chains\\nIn the above agentic RAG formulation we allow the LLM to use its discretion in generating a tool call to help answer user queries. This is a good general-purpose solution, but comes with some trade-offs:\\n✅ Benefits⚠️ DrawbacksSearch only when needed – The LLM can handle greetings, follow-ups, and simple queries without triggering unnecessary searches.Two inference calls – When a search is performed, it requires one call to generate the query and another to produce the final response.Contextual search queries – By treating search as a tool with a query input, the LLM crafts its own queries that incorporate conversational context.Reduced control – The LLM may skip searches when they are actually needed, or issue extra searches when unnecessary.Multiple searches allowed – The LLM can execute several searches in support of a single user query.\\nAnother common approach is a two-step chain, in which we always run a search (potentially using the raw user query) and incorporate the result as context for a single LLM query. This results in a single inference call per query, buying reduced latency at the expense of flexibility.\\nIn this approach we no longer call the model in a loop, but instead make a single pass.\\nWe can implement this chain by removing tools from the agent and instead incorporating the retrieval step into a custom prompt:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest\\n\\n@dynamic_prompt\\ndef prompt_with_context(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Inject context into state messages.\"\"\"\\n    last_query = request.state[\"messages\"][-1].text\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_query)\\n\\n    docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n    system_message = (\\n        \"You are a helpful assistant. Use the following context in your response:\"\\n        f\"\\\\n\\\\n{docs_content}\"\\n    )\\n\\n    return system_message\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools=[], middleware=[prompt_with_context])\\n\\nLet’s try this out:\\nCopyquery = \"What is task decomposition?\"\\nfor step in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is task decomposition?\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nTask decomposition is...\\n\\nIn the LangSmith trace we can see the retrieved context incorporated into the model prompt.\\nThis is a fast and effective method for simple queries in constrained settings, when we typically do want to run user queries through semantic search to pull additional context.\\nReturning source documentsThe above RAG chain incorporates retrieved context into a single system message for that run.As in the agentic RAG formulation, we sometimes want to include raw source documents in the application state to have access to document metadata. We can do this for the two-step chain case by:\\nAdding a key to the state to store the retrieved documents\\nAdding a new node via a pre-model hook to populate that key (as well as inject the context).\\nCopyfrom typing import Any\\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\\nfrom langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, AgentState\\n\\n\\nclass State(AgentState):\\n    context: list[Document]\\n\\n\\nclass RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware(AgentMiddleware[State]):\\n    state_schema = State\\n\\n    def before_model(self, state: AgentState) -> dict[str, Any] | None:\\n        last_message = state[\"messages\"][-1]\\n        retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_message.text)\\n\\n        docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n        augmented_message_content = (\\n            f\"{last_message.text}\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n            \"Use the following context to answer the query:\\\\n\"\\n            f\"{docs_content}\"\\n        )\\n        return {\\n            \"messages\": [last_message.model_copy(update={\"content\": augmented_message_content})],\\n            \"context\": retrieved_docs,\\n        }\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model,\\n    tools=[],\\n    middleware=[RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware()],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bNext steps\\nNow that we’ve implemented a simple RAG application via create_agent, we can easily incorporate new features and go deeper:\\n\\nStream tokens and other information for responsive user experiences\\nAdd conversational memory to support multi-turn interactions\\nAdd long-term memory to support memory across conversational threads\\nAdd structured responses\\nDeploy your application with LangSmith Deployments\\n\\n\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\nConnect these docs programmatically to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoBuild a semantic search engine with LangChainPreviousBuild a SQL agentNext⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify')],\n",

This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bLoading documents\\nWe need to first load the blog post contents. We can use DocumentLoaders for this, which are objects that load in data from a source and return a list of Document objects.\\nIn this case we’ll use the WebBaseLoader, which uses urllib to load HTML from web URLs and BeautifulSoup to parse it to text. We can customize the HTML -> text parsing by passing in parameters into the BeautifulSoup parser via bs_kwargs (see BeautifulSoup docs). In this case only HTML tags with class “post-content”, “post-title”, or “post-header” are relevant, so we’ll remove all others.\\nCopyimport bs4\\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\\n\\n# Only keep post title, headers, and content from the full HTML.\\nbs4_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=(\"post-title\", \"post-header\", \"post-content\"))\\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\\n    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),\\n    bs_kwargs={\"parse_only\": bs4_strainer},\\n)\\ndocs = loader.load()\\n\\nassert len(docs) == 1\\nprint(f\"Total characters: {len(docs[0].page_content)}\")\\n\\nCopyTotal characters: 43131\\n\\nCopyprint(docs[0].page_content[:500])\\n\\nCopy      LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\n\\nDate: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\\n\\n\\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn\\n\\nGo deeper\\nDocumentLoader: Object that loads data from a source as list of Documents.\\n\\nIntegrations: 160+ integrations to choose from.\\nBaseLoader: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bSplitting documents\\nOur loaded document is over 42k characters which is too long to fit into the context window of many models. Even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find information in very long inputs.\\nTo handle this we’ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant parts of the blog post at run time.\\nAs in the semantic search tutorial, we use a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\\nCopyfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\\n    chunk_size=1000,  # chunk size (characters)\\n    chunk_overlap=200,  # chunk overlap (characters)\\n    add_start_index=True,  # track index in original document\\n)\\nall_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\\n\\nprint(f\"Split blog post into {len(all_splits)} sub-documents.\")\\n\\nCopySplit blog post into 66 sub-documents.\\n\\nGo deeper\\nTextSplitter: Object that splits a list of Document objects into smaller\\nchunks for storage and retrieval.\\n\\nIntegrations\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\n\\u200bStoring documents\\nNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them at runtime. Following the semantic search tutorial, our approach is to embed the contents of each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector store. Given an input query, we can then use vector search to retrieve relevant documents.\\nWe can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the vector store and embeddings model selected at the start of the tutorial.\\nCopydocument_ids = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)\\n\\nprint(document_ids[:3])\\n\\nCopy[\\'07c18af6-ad58-479a-bfb1-d508033f9c64\\', \\'9000bf8e-1993-446f-8d4d-f4e507ba4b8f\\', \\'ba3b5d14-bed9-4f5f-88be-44c88aedc2e6\\']\\n\\nGo deeper\\nEmbeddings: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 30+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nVectorStore: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings.\\n\\nIntegrations: 40+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nThis completes the Indexing portion of the pipeline. At this point we have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question.\\n\\u200b2. Retrieval and Generation\\nRAG applications commonly work as follows:\\n\\nRetrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\\nGenerate: A model produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\\n\\n\\nNow let’s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and returns an answer.\\nWe will demonstrate:\\n\\nA RAG agent that executes searches with a simple tool. This is a good general-purpose implementation.\\nA two-step RAG chain that uses just a single LLM call per query. This is a fast and effective method for simple queries.\\n\\n\\u200bRAG agents\\nOne formulation of a RAG application is as a simple agent with a tool that retrieves information. We can assemble a minimal RAG agent by implementing a tool that wraps our vector store:\\nCopyfrom langchain.tools import tool\\n\\n@tool(response_format=\"content_and_artifact\")\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str):\\n    \"\"\"Retrieve information to help answer a query.\"\"\"\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=2)\\n    serialized = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(\\n        (f\"Source: {doc.metadata}\\\\nContent: {doc.page_content}\")\\n        for doc in retrieved_docs\\n    )\\n    return serialized, retrieved_docs\\n\\nHere we use the tool decorator to configure the tool to attach raw documents as artifacts to each ToolMessage. This will let us access document metadata in our application, separate from the stringified representation that is sent to the model.\\nRetrieval tools are not limited to a single string query argument, as in the above example. You can\\nforce the LLM to specify additional search parameters by adding arguments— for example, a category:Copyfrom typing import Literal\\n\\ndef retrieve_context(query: str, section: Literal[\"beginning\", \"middle\", \"end\"]):\\n\\nGiven our tool, we can construct the agent:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\\n\\n\\ntools = [retrieve_context]\\n# If desired, specify custom instructions\\nprompt = (\\n    \"You have access to a tool that retrieves context from a blog post. \"\\n    \"Use the tool to help answer user queries.\"\\n)\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools, system_prompt=prompt)\\n\\nLet’s test this out. We construct a question that would typically require an iterative sequence of retrieval steps to answer:\\nCopyquery = (\\n    \"What is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n    \"Once you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\"\\n)\\n\\nfor event in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is the standard method for Task Decomposition?\\n\\nOnce you get the answer, look up common extensions of that method.\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337)\\n Call ID: call_d6AVxICMPQYwAKj9lgH4E337\\n  Args:\\n    query: standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\nTool Calls:\\n  retrieve_context (call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR)\\n Call ID: call_0dbMOw7266jvETbXWn4JqWpR\\n  Args:\\n    query: common extensions of the standard method for Task Decomposition\\n================================= Tool Message =================================\\nName: retrieve_context\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Task decomposition can be done...\\n\\nSource: {\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\'}\\nContent: Component One: Planning...\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nThe standard method for Task Decomposition often used is the Chain of Thought (CoT)...\\n\\nNote that the agent:\\n\\nGenerates a query to search for a standard method for task decomposition;\\nReceiving the answer, generates a second query to search for common extensions of it;\\nHaving received all necessary context, answers the question.\\n\\nWe can see the full sequence of steps, along with latency and other metadata, in the LangSmith trace.\\nYou can add a deeper level of control and customization using the LangGraph framework directly— for example, you can add steps to grade document relevance and rewrite search queries. Check out LangGraph’s Agentic RAG tutorial for more advanced formulations.\\n\\u200bRAG chains\\nIn the above agentic RAG formulation we allow the LLM to use its discretion in generating a tool call to help answer user queries. This is a good general-purpose solution, but comes with some trade-offs:\\n✅ Benefits⚠️ DrawbacksSearch only when needed – The LLM can handle greetings, follow-ups, and simple queries without triggering unnecessary searches.Two inference calls – When a search is performed, it requires one call to generate the query and another to produce the final response.Contextual search queries – By treating search as a tool with a query input, the LLM crafts its own queries that incorporate conversational context.Reduced control – The LLM may skip searches when they are actually needed, or issue extra searches when unnecessary.Multiple searches allowed – The LLM can execute several searches in support of a single user query.\\nAnother common approach is a two-step chain, in which we always run a search (potentially using the raw user query) and incorporate the result as context for a single LLM query. This results in a single inference call per query, buying reduced latency at the expense of flexibility.\\nIn this approach we no longer call the model in a loop, but instead make a single pass.\\nWe can implement this chain by removing tools from the agent and instead incorporating the retrieval step into a custom prompt:\\nCopyfrom langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest\\n\\n@dynamic_prompt\\ndef prompt_with_context(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Inject context into state messages.\"\"\"\\n    last_query = request.state[\"messages\"][-1].text\\n    retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_query)\\n\\n    docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n    system_message = (\\n        \"You are a helpful assistant. Use the following context in your response:\"\\n        f\"\\\\n\\\\n{docs_content}\"\\n    )\\n\\n    return system_message\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(model, tools=[], middleware=[prompt_with_context])\\n\\nLet’s try this out:\\nCopyquery = \"What is task decomposition?\"\\nfor step in agent.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": query}]},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n):\\n    step[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\nCopy================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nWhat is task decomposition?\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nTask decomposition is...\\n\\nIn the LangSmith trace we can see the retrieved context incorporated into the model prompt.\\nThis is a fast and effective method for simple queries in constrained settings, when we typically do want to run user queries through semantic search to pull additional context.\\nReturning source documentsThe above RAG chain incorporates retrieved context into a single system message for that run.As in the agentic RAG formulation, we sometimes want to include raw source documents in the application state to have access to document metadata. We can do this for the two-step chain case by:\\nAdding a key to the state to store the retrieved documents\\nAdding a new node via a pre-model hook to populate that key (as well as inject the context).\\nCopyfrom typing import Any\\nfrom langchain_core.documents import Document\\nfrom langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, AgentState\\n\\n\\nclass State(AgentState):\\n    context: list[Document]\\n\\n\\nclass RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware(AgentMiddleware[State]):\\n    state_schema = State\\n\\n    def before_model(self, state: AgentState) -> dict[str, Any] | None:\\n        last_message = state[\"messages\"][-1]\\n        retrieved_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(last_message.text)\\n\\n        docs_content = \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs)\\n\\n        augmented_message_content = (\\n            f\"{last_message.text}\\\\n\\\\n\"\\n            \"Use the following context to answer the query:\\\\n\"\\n            f\"{docs_content}\"\\n        )\\n        return {\\n            \"messages\": [last_message.model_copy(update={\"content\": augmented_message_content})],\\n            \"context\": retrieved_docs,\\n        }\\n\\n\\nagent = create_agent(\\n    model,\\n    tools=[],\\n    middleware=[RetrieveDocumentsMiddleware()],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bNext steps\\nNow that we’ve implemented a simple RAG application via create_agent, we can easily incorporate new features and go deeper:\\n\\nStream tokens and other information for responsive user experiences\\nAdd conversational memory to support multi-turn interactions\\nAdd long-term memory to support memory across conversational threads\\nAdd structured responses\\nDeploy your application with LangSmith Deployments\\n\\n\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\nConnect these docs programmatically to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoBuild a semantic search engine with LangChainPreviousBuild a SQL agentNext⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify')],\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='Sure! Here’s a quick snapshot of **LangChain**—what it is, why it matters, and how you can start using it. Let me know if you’d like deeper details on any particular area (e.g., code examples, deployment, integrations, or a comparison with LangGraph).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1️⃣ What is LangChain?\\n\\n**LangChain** is an open‑source framework that makes it easier to build **applications powered by large language models (LLMs)**. It does this by providing modular, reusable building blocks for:\\n\\n| Layer | What it does | Typical components |\\n|------|--------------|--------------------|\\n| **LLM** | Calls to any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.) | `OpenAI`, `ChatOpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere` wrappers |\\n| **Prompt** | Structured prompt creation & templating | `PromptTemplate`, `FewShotPromptTemplate`, `ChatPromptTemplate` |\\n| **Memory** | Persists context across turns (chat, agents) | `ConversationBufferMemory`, `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory`, `SummaryMemory` |\\n| **Chains** | Sequential or parallel composition of LLM calls, prompts, and utilities | `LLMChain`, `SequentialChain`, `RouterChain`, `TransformChain` |\\n| **Agents** | Dynamic decision‑making: choose tools, run actions, loop until a goal is met | `ZeroShotAgent`, `ToolCallingAgent`, `ReactAgent`, `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` |\\n| **Tools** | External APIs or utilities that agents can invoke (search, DB, calculators, etc.) | `SerpAPI`, `SQLDatabaseTool`, `PythonREPL`, custom HTTP tools |\\n| **Retrievers / Vector Stores** | Ground LLM output in external knowledge (RAG) | `FAISS`, `Pinecone`, `Weaviate`, `Chroma`, `Milvus` |\\n| **Evaluation** | Automated testing of LLM outputs | `LLMEvalChain`, `ChatEvalChain`, custom metrics |\\n| **Callbacks** | Hooks for logging, tracing, streaming, UI integration | `ConsoleCallbackHandler`, `LangChainTracer`, `OpenTelemetry` |\\n\\nAll of these pieces are **plug‑and‑play**, so you can mix‑and‑match to create anything from a simple Q&A bot to a sophisticated autonomous agent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2️⃣ Why Use LangChain?\\n\\n| Benefit | Explanation |\\n|--------|-------------|\\n| **Productivity** – No need to reinvent prompt handling, memory, or tool‑calling logic. |\\n| **Portability** – Same code works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, Azure, HuggingFace, Anthropic, etc.). |\\n| **Extensibility** – Easy to add custom tools, memory stores, or evaluation metrics. |\\n| **Community & Ecosystem** – Rich set of integrations (vector DBs, APIs, UI frameworks) and a vibrant open‑source community. |\\n| **Observability** – Built‑in callbacks for tracing, debugging, and monitoring. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3️⃣ Core Concepts & Quick Code Sketch\\n\\nBelow is a **minimal “chat with memory”** example using Python. It demonstrates the most common pieces: LLM, prompt template, memory, and a chain.\\n\\n```python\\n# Install first\\n# pip install langchain openai\\n\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\\n\\n# 1️⃣ LLM wrapper (uses your OPENAI_API_KEY)\\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0.7)\\n\\n# 2️⃣ Prompt template (you can also use ChatPromptTemplate for chat messages)\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant that remembers the conversation.\"),\\n    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"{question}\")\\n])\\n\\n# 3️⃣ Memory – keeps the whole conversation\\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", return_messages=True)\\n\\n# 4️⃣ Chain – ties everything together\\nchat_chain = LLMChain(\\n    llm=llm,\\n    prompt=prompt,\\n    memory=memory,\\n    verbose=True  # prints intermediate steps\\n)\\n\\n# 5️⃣ Interact\\nwhile True:\\n    user_input = input(\"\\\\nYou: \")\\n    if user_input.lower() in {\"exit\", \"quit\"}:\\n        break\\n    answer = chat_chain.run(question=user_input)\\n    print(\"\\\\nAssistant:\", answer)\\n```\\n\\n**What happens under the hood?**\\n\\n1. Your input is rendered into the prompt template.\\n2. The `ConversationBufferMemory` appends the new user message and the previous assistant response to the prompt, giving the LLM full context.\\n3. The `LLMChain` calls the LLM, returns the answer, and stores it back in memory.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4️⃣ Building More Advanced Apps\\n\\n### a. Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\\n\\n# 1️⃣ Create a vector store from your docs\\ndocs = [...]  # list of LangChain Document objects\\nvectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())\\n\\n# 2️⃣ Retriever\\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 4})\\n\\n# 3️⃣ QA chain\\nqa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(\\n    llm=OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\"),\\n    chain_type=\"stuff\",   # can be \"map_reduce\", \"refine\", etc.\\n    retriever=retriever,\\n    return_source_documents=True,\\n)\\n\\n# 4️⃣ Ask a question\\nresult = qa({\"query\": \"How does LangChain handle tool calling?\"})\\nprint(result[\"answer\"])\\nprint(\"\\\\nSources:\")\\nfor doc in result[\"source_documents\"]:\\n    print(\"-\", doc.metadata.get(\"source\"))\\n```\\n\\n### b. Tool‑Calling Agents (React/Function‑Calling)\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\\nfrom langchain.tools import SerpAPIWrapper, PythonREPLTool\\n\\ntools = [\\n    Tool(\\n        name=\"Search\",\\n        func=SerpAPIWrapper().run,\\n        description=\"Useful for searching the web for up‑to‑date facts.\"\\n    ),\\n    Tool(\\n        name=\"Python REPL\",\\n        func=PythonREPLTool().run,\\n        description=\"Executes arbitrary Python code.\"\\n    ),\\n]\\n\\nagent = initialize_agent(\\n    tools,\\n    OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0),\\n    agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\",\\n    verbose=True,\\n)\\n\\nagent.run(\"What was the closing price of AAPL on 2024‑10‑01 and plot it with a simple line chart.\")\\n```\\n\\nThe agent decides whether to **search**, **run Python**, or **answer directly**, looping until it reaches a final answer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5️⃣ LangChain vs. LangGraph\\n\\n| Feature | LangChain | LangGraph |\\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\\n| **Primary focus** | Building *chains* and *agents* (sequential or branching). | Designing *state‑ful, graph‑based workflows* (think “workflow engine”). |\\n| **Abstractions** | Chains, Agents, Memory, Retrievers, Tools. | Nodes, Edges, State, Conditional logic, Loops. |\\n| **When to use** | Quick prototypes, RAG, tool‑calling bots, simple or moderately complex pipelines. | Complex multi‑step orchestration, long‑running processes, need explicit state tracking and branching (e.g., multi‑stage data pipelines, multi‑agent coordination). |\\n| **Interoperability** | Fully compatible – you can embed a LangChain *Chain* or *Agent* as a node inside a LangGraph graph. | Uses LangChain components under the hood; you can swap them in/out. |\\n\\nIf you start with a simple chatbot, stick with **LangChain**. When your application grows into a multi‑stage workflow (e.g., “fetch data → summarize → generate report → send email”), consider moving that logic into **LangGraph** for clearer state handling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6️⃣ Getting Started & Resources\\n\\n| Resource | Link |\\n|----------|------|\\n| **Official Docs** | <https://python.langchain.com> |\\n| **Quick‑Start Notebook** | <https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb> |\\n| **Community Slack** | <https://langchain.slack.com> (invite via the website) |\\n| **GitHub Repo** | <https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain> |\\n| **Video Walkthroughs** | LangChain YouTube channel – “Building a Retrieval‑Augmented Chatbot” |\\n| **Blog Posts** | “LangChain 0.2 Release Highlights” (Oct\\u202f2024) – covers new callbacks & async support. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7️⃣ What Next?\\n\\n- **Pick a use‑case**: Q&A bot, data extraction, autonomous agent, etc.\\n- **Choose a vector store** if you need RAG (FAISS for local dev, Pinecone/Weaviate for production).\\n- **Add memory** if you need multi‑turn context.\\n- **Iterate**: start with a simple `LLMChain`, then layer in retrieval, tools, and finally an agent or a LangGraph workflow.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🎯 Quick Checklist for a Minimal Production‑Ready Bot\\n\\n1. **Environment** – Secure API keys (use `.env` + `python-dotenv`).\\n2. **LLM Provider** – Choose a model with the right cost/latency trade‑off.\\n3. **Prompt Management** – Keep prompts in separate files or a prompt‑store for versioning.\\n4. **Vector Store** – Persist embeddings; set up periodic re‑indexing if docs change.\\n5. **Memory** – Use a durable store (Redis, DynamoDB) for long‑term sessions.\\n6. **Observability** – Enable LangChain callbacks → log to your monitoring stack.\\n7. **Safety** – Add content filters or guardrails (OpenAI moderation, custom heuristics).\\n8. **Testing** – Write unit tests with `LangChainEvalChain` or mock LLM responses.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me know which part you’d like to dive deeper into—code samples, deployment tips, advanced agent patterns, LangGraph integration, or anything else! 🚀', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'The user just says \"Langchain\".

       "  AIMessage(content='**Machine learning (ML)** is a sub‑field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can **learn from data** and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed for every possible situation.\\n\\n### Core Idea\\n- **Traditional programming:** You write explicit rules (if‑else statements) that tell a computer exactly what to do.\\n- **Machine learning:** You give the computer **examples (data)** and a **goal** (e.g., predict a label, generate a recommendation). The computer automatically discovers patterns and creates a model that can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\\n\\n### How It Works (High‑Level Pipeline)\\n\\n| Step | Description |\\n|------|-------------|\\n| 1️⃣ **Define the problem** | Classification, regression, clustering, recommendation, generation, etc. |\\n| 2️⃣ **Collect data** | Gather relevant, representative data (images, text, sensor readings, etc.). |\\n| 3️⃣ **Prepare data** | Clean, label, normalize, split into training/validation/test sets. |\\n| 4️⃣ **Choose a model** | Linear models, decision trees, neural networks, support‑vector machines, etc. |\\n| 5️⃣ **Train the model** | Feed the training data to the algorithm; it adjusts internal parameters to minimize a loss function. |\\n| 6️⃣ **Validate & tune** | Evaluate on validation data, adjust hyper‑parameters, prevent over‑/under‑fitting. |\\n| 7️⃣ **Test & deploy** | Measure final performance on a held‑out test set, then integrate into an application. |\\n| 8️⃣ **Monitor & update** | Continuously track performance;

training aims to minimize it.\\n- **Overfitting / Underfitting:** Overfitting = model memorizes training data and fails on new data; underfitting = model is too simple to capture patterns.\\n- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into informative inputs for the model (e.g., scaling, encoding categorical variables, extracting text n‑grams).\\n- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision/recall, F1‑score, ROC‑AUC (classification); RMSE, MAE (regression); silhouette score (clustering).\\n\\n### Popular Tools & Frameworks\\n\\n| Domain | Libraries / Platforms |\\n|--------|-----------------------|\\n| General ML / Data preprocessing | **scikit‑learn**, **pandas**, **NumPy** |\\n| Deep learning | **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Keras**, **JAX** |\\n| AutoML | **Auto‑sklearn**, **TPOT**, **Google Cloud AutoML**, **H2O.ai** |\\n| Model serving | **TensorFlow Serving**, **TorchServe**, **FastAPI**, **MLflow**, **Docker/Kubernetes** |\\n| Experiment tracking | **Weights & Biases**, **MLflow**, **Neptune.ai** |\\n\\n### Real‑World Applications\\n\\n| Sector | Example |\\n|--------|---------|\\n| **Healthcare** | Disease diagnosis from medical images, drug discovery, patient risk stratification |\\n| **Finance** | Credit scoring, fraud detection, algorithmic trading |\\n| **Retail & E‑commerce** | Product recommendation, demand forecasting, dynamic pricing |\\n| **Transportation** | Autonomous driving perception, route optimization, predictive maintenance |\\n| **Entertainment** | Content recommendation (Netflix, Spotify), video game AI, music generation |\\n| **Manufacturing** | Quality inspection via computer vision, predictive equipment failure |\\n| **Natural Language Processing** | Chatbots, sentiment analysis, machine translation, code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot) |\\n\\n### Why Machine Learning Matters\\n\\n1. **Scalability:** Automates tasks that would be impossible or too costly for humans to code manually.\\n2. **Adaptability:** Models can be retrained with new data, allowing systems to evolve as the world changes.\\n3. **Insight Discovery:** Uncovers hidden patterns, correlations, and predictive signals that may not be obvious to domain experts.\\n4. **Economic Impact:** Drives efficiency, creates new products/services, and opens up entirely new business models.\\n\\n### Getting Started (If You’re New)\\n\\n1. **Learn the basics of Python** (the de‑facto language for ML) and libraries like **pandas** and **NumPy**.\\n2. **Study fundamental concepts**: linear regression, logistic regression, gradient descent, overfitting, cross‑validation.\\n3. **Complete a hands‑on project**: e.g., Kaggle’s “Titanic” classification or a simple house‑price regression using scikit‑learn.\\n4. **Explore deep learning** with a tutorial on building a basic image classifier in PyTorch or TensorFlow.\\n5. **Read and practice**: “Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” (Aurélien Géron) is an excellent beginner‑to‑intermediate guide.\\n6. **Join communities**: Kaggle, Stack Overflow, r/MachineLearning, and AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML) for staying current.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In a nutshell:** Machine learning equips computers with the ability to **learn patterns from data** and make predictions or decisions, enabling a wide array of intelligent applications across virtually every industry.', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'User asks \"What is Machine learning?\" Simple definition.
